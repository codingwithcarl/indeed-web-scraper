The Project:
CodeBig is an API proxying service that provides rate limiting and authentication services to internal APIs.

We’re a supportive, collaborative team that believes in mentoring and supporting all our colleagues. We’ve adopted lightweight agile processes that we apply to improve the way we all work together.
The Team:
We value delivering usable and working solutions now and iterative refinement over holding out for a perfect solution later.
We value attitude over aptitude; no genius jerks allowed.
We value individuals and interactions over process and tools (yes, we borrowed this one).
We value using good enough open source software over perfect commercial software.
We value diversity of opinion over group consensus.
During technical discussions, no one has a title.
We value being able to pursue a plan together over everyone agreeing that the plan is the best one.
We value context and responsibility over management approval and supervision.
We start from the assumption that someone, somewhere has already figured out a solution to this problem; we value using their results over rediscovering them ourselves.
We value leadership through service over fighting turf wars; we get ahead by helping others succeed.
We value actively and humbly seeking honest feedback over preserving our egos.
We treat customers as future collaborators rather than as tickets to be closed.
We are good listeners, and listen twice as much as we talk. (2 ears, 1 mouth)

2+ years of relevant work experience, including deployment automation skills
Programming experience and mentoring skills.
We favor experience in multiple languages and deployment tools over expertise in any given language. However; in this role, experience in Ansible and Terraform is most likely to be helpful to the team.
UNIX/Linux background: facility with command command-line utilities; familiarity with system administration tools and concepts a plus.
Experience integrating Open Source tools and libraries to build complete solutions.
BS in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related technical field or equivalent practical experience.
Experience developing service oriented architectures and an understanding of design for scalability, performance and reliability.
Experience with high-scale, distributed web service development (hands-on experience with RESTful web services)
